# maya_ci_unittests
Example repository for CI tested Maya scripts.


Use workflows>maya_unittests.yml, tests-folder and base.py as-is. Change example_code.py and create tests accordingly.

run_tests.bat is a little convenience executable to run tests locally on Windows machines.

test_transform.py has some common test assertions.
